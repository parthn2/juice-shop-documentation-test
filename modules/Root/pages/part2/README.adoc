= Part II - Challenge hunting

This part of the book can be read from end to end as a _hacking guide_.
Used in that way you will be walked through various types of web
vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit their occurrences in the Juice
Shop application. Alternatively you can start hacking the Juice Shop on
your own and use this part simply as a reference and _source of hints_
in case you get stuck at a particular challenge.

In case you want to look up hints for a particular challenge, the
following tables lists all challenges of the OWASP Juice Shop grouped by
their difficulty and in the same order as they appear on the Score
Board.

_The challenge hints found in this release of the companion guide are
compatible with {{book.juiceShopVersion}} of OWASP Juice Shop._

== Challenge Solutions

In case you are getting frustrated with a particular challenge, you can
refer to the xref:/appendix/solutions.adoc[Challenge solutions] appendix
where you find explicit instructions how to successfully exploit each
vulnerability. It is highly recommended to use this option only as a
last resort. You will learn *a lot more* from hacking entirely on your
own or relying only on the hints in this part of the book.
